This is a demo Corona app that features my Twilio Rest API class for Corona SDK (http://www.coronalabs.com)

TwilioRestClient source is in TwilioCoronaApp/Twilio

Open the TwilioCoronaApp folder up with Corona Simulator to view the app.

At this point, TwilioRestClient only supports Rest HTTP requests. TwiML is not yet finished and probbaly won't ever be.
